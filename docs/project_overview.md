# Project Overview: AI Research Agent

## Problem Statement
Academic researchers need intelligent tools to discover, analyze, and synthesize literature efficiently. Traditional manual research is time-consuming and may miss relevant papers.

## Solution
AI Research Agent using IBM Granite and RAG architecture to:
- Automatically search academic databases
- Analyze multiple papers simultaneously  
- Generate comprehensive research insights
- Provide citations and structured reports

## Technical Implementation
- **Platform**: IBM watsonx.ai Studio
- **AI Model**: IBM Granite-13B-Chat-v2  
- **Architecture**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- **Data Source**: arXiv Academic Papers

## Key Results
- Successfully processed 3+ research papers
- Generated intelligent analysis using IBM Granite
- Demonstrated end-to-end RAG workflow
- Created production-ready research tool

## Architecture Overview

### RAG Implementation
1. **Retrieval Phase**: Query arXiv API for relevant papers
2. **Processing Phase**: Extract and clean paper content
3. **Generation Phase**: Use IBM Granite for intelligent analysis
4. **Synthesis Phase**: Combine insights from multiple sources

### Key Components
- **Search Engine**: arXiv API integration
- **Content Processor**: PDF and text extraction
- **AI Engine**: IBM Granite foundation model
- **Output Generator**: Structured research reports
